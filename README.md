# tkinter_projects
will host my various tkinter projects and track my progress. began learning tkinter 8/2/22. 
I'm aiming to create a series of smaller projects and read the tkinter documentation first, but
will complete my initial learning phase of the tkinter module by attempting to build an interface
for various apps. It should be comprehensive and be comprised of 3+ main parts:

-the login page. this should be a home page that allows users to register for an account
or login to an existing account. It should validate the user's account and then proceed to...

-the options page. this is a page to view the various apps. You should be able to scroll/tab over
to whatever apps you'd like to use, see a small description/sample of the app and then use it.

-the apps page. At minimum, I'd like to have a game and some kind of API to work on my API knowledge. 
Currently I am planning on making a weather app that displays accurate, up to date readings(using an API)
and a game, such as tic-tac-toe that you can play against the computer(interactively using tkinter)

Skills being practiced:
-manipulating files and (possibly) security. I will be storing user data in files and using various images, 
so this will be a good way to practice file I/O and possibly encrypting the user data within the files
   
-tkinter. building an interface with many interacting windows, widgets, and passable aesthetics
should be an ample test and a suitable barrier to clear to say that I have a working knowledge of tkinter

-project design and management. this is a good chance to create a large project that needs to be broken 
down into smaller steps, planned out, and duly implemented. I can review this in the future and practice 
new design patterns and best practices as well. 

-API's and dealing with data. the weather app will require me to work intimately with an API from a weather
database and use this to dynamically update the tkinter interface every day. this should be a solid introduction
to API's and how to incorporate them in tkinter

Additional features(ever changing list, NOT required to move on from tkinter):
-in rough order of priority:
-make windows expandable while maintaining functionality and aesthetics
-improve the aesthetics(rather vague, but implement styles and look online for examples)
-carry over password if entered on login page to the registration page
-encrypt the user data stored within files and learn about security best practices
-allow the user to generate a custom password
-show astericks(***) when the user is entering a password, and allow them to toggle this
-add pictures to the options menu
